# ðŸ“œ Books Store
A simple web-application built on NextJS and TypeScript. Renders a list of books to end-user and allows admin to perform CRUD operations on books, as well as update images via Cloudinary. Built this project to learn NextJS and file uploading, and also to master my skills in building CRUD operations.
